## Switches
- Each case is evaluated one time
- `break` is used to end
- `default` is used at the end of all cases as a catch-all if no match found

## Exports
- Used to export a function from current file into another
- Must `require` the export from another file

## Encoding vs Translating
- Encoding is used to return convert string to a new string of values
- Translating is for finding actual complete value of string
